# Scrolling display project based on Chinese language corpus

## Introduction

This project aims to conduct a novel reading task with **real-time highlighted character** based on **Chinese language corpora** while simultaneously recording participants' brainwave (EEG) and eye movement (eye-tracking) data. The collected data can be utilized for EEG language decoding and related research endeavors.

## Device Models

EGI: 128-channel

eyetracker: Tobii Glass 3

## Environment

**This project must be based on Python version 3.10!!!** You can use Anaconda to create a new environment to run this project. The command is as follows:

```
conda create -n psychopy_tobii python=3.10
```

Then you can activate this environment to install packages we need:

```
conda activate psychopy_tobii
```

### Psychopy

The entire experimental program is written based on Psychopy. You can download Psychopy either through the command line using the following command or by downloading it from the Psychopy official website: https://www.psychopy.org/.

```
pip install psychopy
```

There are two modes in Psychopy: builder and coder. In our project, we use the coder to implement our experiment.

```

For more information about this package, you can visit this website: https://github.com/nimh-sfim/egi-pynetstation

## Code Explanation

Before you conduct the experiment, you should first cut your novel to our required format using `cut_Chinese_novel.py` in the `novel_segmentation` section. You can read the README in that section for detailed information. 

If you have already succesfully done that, you can run `PlayNovel.py` to start the main experiment.

### Main Experiment

#### Main Procedure

`PlayNovel.py` is used to run the main experiment based on Psychopy. 

![](https://github.com/ncclabsustech/Chinese_reading_task_eeg_processing/blob/main/image/screen.png)

The program includes multiple modes, allowing you to choose whether to connect to the EGI and eye tracker for the experiment. The experimental procedure mainly consists of eye tracker calibration (if the eye tracker mode is selected), practice reading, formal reading, and breaks between chapters. During the reading process, the novel will be presented on the screen with three lines per page, and each line will not exceed ten Chinese characters (excluding punctuation marks). On each page, the middle line will be highlighted as the focal point, while the upper and lower lines will be displayed with reduced intensity as the background. Each character in the middle line will be sequentially highlighted for a certain duration, and participants will be asked to follow the highlighted cues to read the novel content. Various parameters, such as individual character highlight duration, highlight color, etc., can be adjusted by modifying the corresponding settings. 

#### Parameters

Detailed explanations of the parameters will be provided below. Note that you must change the bold parameter to your own settings, or there may be some errors and calculation inaccuracies.

**Notice**: As mentioned in the previous section, we may run this script multiple times in the experiment to sequentially present each part of the novel. You need to specify the parameter "isFirstSession" every time you run this program to let it know if this is the first playback. If the value is "True," the program will play the preface to do practice reading before the formal reading begins. If it is "False," the practice reading part will be skipped, and the program will start directly from the main content.

#### EEG Markers

If you use the EGI device to record EEG signals during the experiment, our program will place markers at certain corresponding time points. These markers will assist you in aligning eye tracker recordings and EEG signals, as well as locating texts corresponding to specific segments of EEG signals.

The detailed information of markers are shown below:

```
EYES: Eyetracker starts to record
EYEE: Eyetracker stops recording
CALS: Eyetracker calibration starts
CALE: Eyetracker calibration stops
BEGN: EGI starts to record
STOP: EGI stops recording
CH01：Beginning of specific chapter (Numbers correspond with chapters) 
ROWS: Beginning of a row
ROWE: End of a row
PRES：Beginning of the preface
PREE：End of the preface

BEGN → 1
STOP → 2
EYEE → 3
EYES → 4
CALS → 5
CALE → 6
PRES → 7
PREE → 8
ROWS → 9
ROWE → 10
CH01-CH40 → 11-50
```

#### Calibration Coordinate Transformation

In this experimental program, we designed a personalized calibration procedure. A dot will appear sequentially at the four corners and center of the screen, each staying for 5 seconds. Participants are required to fixate on the center of the dot to complete the calibration. For each dot, we record the middle and later segment of the participant's gaze data (from 3s to 4s) and calculate the average point of gaze as the participant's mean fixation point. We then compare the average fixation point with the actual center position of the dot to calculate the error. By averaging the errors from all five dots, we obtain the final calibration error. If the final error is below the predetermined error threshold, we consider the calibration as successful. If the calibration is not successful, the experimental program will automatically return to the calibration phase and repeat the process until calibration is achieved.

In order to align the coordinate systems of the eye tracker and the Psychopy program to obtain the actual positions of gaze points on the screen, we derived a transformation formula between the coordinate systems of the eye tracker and the Psychopy program using geometric relationships. This formula was then applied during the calibration process. The specific relationship is as follows:
```math
x_{\text{eyetracker}} = (\frac{{W \cdot x_{\text{psychopy}}}}{{d \cdot r \cdot \tan(\text{width\_degree/2})}} + 1 )  \cdot \frac{1}{2}
```
```math
y_{\text{eyetracker}} = (1 - \frac{{H \cdot y_{\text{psychopy}}}}{{d \cdot \tan(\text{height\_degree/2})}} )\cdot \frac{1}{2}
```
where:
```math
(x_{eyetracker}, y_{eyetracker}) \ is \ the \ coordinate \ in \ the \ eyetracker\ coordinate \ system
```
```math
(x_{psychopy}, y_{psychopy}) \ is \ the \ coordinate \ in \ the \ psychopy\ coordinate \ system
```
```math
W \ : \ the \ width \ of \ the \ screen
```
```math
H \ : \ the \ height \ of \ the \ screen
```
```math
r \ : \ the \ ratio \ of \ the \ width \ to \ the \ height
```
```math
width\_degree \ : \ the\ horizontal\ scanning\ range\ of\ the\ eyetracking \ camera\ in\ degree\ ( both \ sides \ together)
```
```math
height\_degree \ : \ the\ vertical\ scanning\ range\ of\ the\ eyetracking \ camera\ in\ degree\ ( both \ sides \ together)
```


## Experiment Procedure

The experimental setup is as below:

![](https://github.com/ncclabsustech/Chinese_reading_task_eeg_processing/blob/main/image/exp_layout.png)

Below are the operational steps and an example of starting the project from scratch, using the novel *The Little Prince* as an example.

### Activate Environment

First, activate the environment we set up before, and then navigate to the directory where the project is located.

```
conda activate psychopy_tobii
cd <your_path_to_project>
```

### Novel Segmentation

Take a `.txt` novel file that meets the format requirements (format requirements can be found in the "Sentence Segmentation" section of the Code Explanation) as input. Specify the parameter to divide the text into several parts. Run `cut_Chinese_novel.py`, and you will obtain the corresponding number of `.xlsx` files. Here, we divided the novel into 4 main parts, resulting in 5 files (4 main body parts and 1 preface part).

```
python cut_Chinese_novel.py --divide_num=8,16,24 --Chinese_novel_path=xiaowangzi_main_text.txt
```

### Main Experiment

- First, connect the EGI equipment and the eye tracker.
- Next, adjust the parameters and run the main program. Set the addresses for the main body and preface parts in the variables `novel_path` and `preface_path`, respectively. Adjust the parameters `add_mark` and `add_eyetracker` to decide whether to connect to the EGI and eye tracker. Change `host_IP`, `egi_IP`, and `eyetracker_hostname` to the IP numbers of your own devices. Set `isFirstSession` to True during the first run to include the preview session. Other adjustable parameters can be found in the "Parameters" section of the Code Explanation under Main Experiment. Note that you may need to modify some size and distance-related parameters according to your own setup. In subsequent runs, change the `novel_path` to read different parts of the novel and set `isFirstSession` to False.

```
python play_novel.py --add_mark --add_eyetracker  --preface_path=<your preface path> --host_IP=<host IP> --egi_IP=<egi IP> --eyetracker_hostname=<eyetracker serial number> --novel_path=<your novel path> --isFirstSession
```

​		Here is our own settings as an example:

```
First time:
python PlayNovel.py --add_mark --add_eyetracker  --preface_path=segmented_Chinense_novel_preface_display.xlsx --host_IP=10.10.10.42 --egi_IP=10.10.10.51 --eyetracker_hostname=TG03B-080202024891 --novel_path=segmented_Chinense_novel_run_1_display.xlsx --isFirstSession

Second time:
python PlayNovel.py --add_mark --add_eyetracker  --preface_path=segmented_Chinense_novel_preface_display.xlsx --host_IP=10.10.10.42 --egi_IP=10.10.10.51 --eyetracker_hostname=TG03B-080202024891 --novel_path=segmented_Chinense_novel_run_2_display.xlsx

...
```

- **During the forced break period, the EGI system will be disconnected. ** ***At this time, you need to restart the EGI system to ensure it is in a running state before the participant continues the experiment, or the program will crash!!!***

- **At the end of each experimental session, it is necessary to replenish the saline for the participant's EEG cap and replace the eye tracker's batteries to ensure sufficient power. Start and reconnect the eye tracker, and restart the EGI system.** ***Remember not to disconnect the eye tracker or replace its batteries during the experiment (including the rest periods) as doing so may cause the program to crash!!!***

- The main process of the experiment includes: calibration - preface session (only in the first part) - formal reading - rest (including mandatory rest and participant-initiated rest periods). After each rest period, recalibration will be performed.

  - Calibration

    **Note: When calibration fails multiple times, the experimenter can choose to skip the calibration and proceed directly to the reading section by pressing the right arrow key on the keyboard at the calibration failure prompt page.**

  - Preface Reading

  - Formal Reading

  - Rest

    **restart the EGI system to ensure it is in a running state before the participant continues the experiment**
